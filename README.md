# Data Science Roadmap

This takes a full year, yes.

## Fundementals and Mathematics

Any mathematical subject, you need to cover it in depth at least once, be exposed to it, know the terminology, you don't need to understand it fully the first time, just understand the core concept and intuition, implementation is available for you to use without having to implement it from scratch, this applies to Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics and Machine Learning

### Primary Resources

- [ritvikmath](https://www.youtube.com/@ritvikmath/playlists): whiteboard, math, low level explanations

- [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown/playlists): 3D visualizations and explanations, high level, watch Essence of Calculus, Essence of Linear Algebra and Neural Networks series

- [StatQuest with Josh Starmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw): your primary source for mathematics and probability explanations

- [In 100 Seconds by Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0vfts4VzfNiI1BsIK5u7LpPaIDKMJIDN): you must go through this playlist at least once in your life

### Advanced Resources
- Linear Algebra by Prof. Gilbert Strang (MIT) (Available on YouTube)
- Deep Learning by Alfredo Canziani and Yann Lecun (NYU) (Available on YouTube) (DS28)
- Stanford CS229: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Stanford) (Available on YouTube)

The following are specializations within data science:

- Stanford CS224N Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning by Christopher Manning (Stanford) (Available on YouTube)
- Stanford Computer Vision by Fei-Fie Li et. al (Stanford) (Available on YouTube)

NOTE: you need to master ML, Deep Learning and NLP before you can use this roadmap, you can use the resources above
- [GenAI Roadmap](https://a-tabaza.github.io/genai_interview_questions/)

### Textbooks

- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, Aurelien Geron
- An Introduction to Statistical Learning, Gareth M. James et. al
- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Christopher Bishop

### Bypass Paywalls

Look up the Wikipedia for URLs, they might change, you need to be able to find them

- Anna's Archive
- SciHub

### Papers
- Google Scholar
- arXiv
- ResearchGate
- Semantic Scholar

## Code

You need to be able to find Code, the following lists ways you can find code snippets

- GitHub search
- Kaggle Code tab
- User Guide and Documentation of Packages (Scikit Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Optuna, Feature Engine, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

## Courses (Must Watch)
